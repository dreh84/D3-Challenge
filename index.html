          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Poverty</h2>
          <p>It shows that people from families whose income falls below the federal poverty thresholds represent a diverse subset of the overall population. 
            There were 38.1 million people living below the federal poverty level, representing 11.8% of the total population.
          </p>

          <p>The United States was highest among people between the ages of 18 and 24 years old, with a rate of 17.1 percent for male Americans and a rate of 21.35 percent for female Americans. 
            The lowest poverty rate for both genders was found in individuals between the ages of 65 and 74 years old.
          </p>

          <p>As our country gets bigger, older and more diverse, the ever-evolving composition of the population will have profound effects on the U.S. health-care system and the people in its care.
            Changes in population size, age, race and ethnicity affect the health-care resources needed, the cost of care provided, and even the conditions associated with each population group. 
            Health-care organizations will have to adapt quickly to meet their patients’ changing needs—all while addressing health-reform requirements.
